# Sequence-Length-and-Amino-Acid-Counter
This Python script involves the use of the Biopython library to perform DNA sequence analysis. It includes functionalities to retrieve sequence data from a FASTA file and conduct a counter for sequence length and for specific amino acids.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Biopython library
## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website.

To install the Biopython library, use the following pip command:

pip install biopython

# Usage
## Codon Table Analysis
The code demonstrates the extraction of codon tables from the Biopython package and prints the standard and mitochondrial DNA codon tables.
## Sequence Analysis
The script reads a DNA sequence from a provided FASTA file, calculates the sequence length, and counts the occurrences of a specific amino acid (in this case, Alanine 'A') within the sequence.
